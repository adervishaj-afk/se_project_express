# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

#### Summary

Topics disuccsed in Sprint:
Node.js,Express.js, Controllers, Routes, Error Messages, Mongoose, MongoDB, Databases, Schema, CRUD, NoSQL

In this project we learned about the framework of servers and the different layers and applications used to interact and develop modern websites such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose.

In this project we set up our server, connected our database and defined the schema's by which our front end users will provide information to the server with. We created routes that will organize where the data will be sent from on the page. In addition, we created Controller files define how what will be done with the data (the CRUD method was applied - Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations you can perform on data in a database. ) Error messages were also added to our methods to provide the user with information regarding the requests they made.
